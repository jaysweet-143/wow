        <h1>My web development journey for the past month</h1>
       <p>I started my html journey on freecodecamp.
       It was a way to improve our html skills on our own, tasked to us by our lecturer.
       It was fun and motivating until our lecturer started putting pressure on us to finish the work on time.
       Most of us, at least I became frustrated because the work was a lot and we have other courses to work on as well.
       I know he has our best interests in mind and that's what keeps me going, at least for now.
       I only wish that he could ease up a bit because with that pressure on me,I am just on freecodecamp to finish the tasks not to better my web development skills.
       I hope that even though I am rushing in finishing the tasks, I am able to remember all I have done.</p>
